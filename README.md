## Project Overview 📑
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting suspicious or potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. This model can help financial institutions to reduce fraud losses and improve customer transaction security.

## About The Dataset ✏
The project utilizes [Credit Card Fraud datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) from Kaggle containing information such as transaction time, transaction amount, and various anonymized features generated through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing only a small fraction of the total transactions.

## Methodology 🍴
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data distribution, identify outliers, and analyze relationships between features.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and address class imbalance (e.g., using oversampling or undersampling techniques).
- Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for modeling using techniques such as correlation analysis.
- Modeling: Develop machine learning model Random Forest and compare when handling imbalanced dataset
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC).

## Results ⭐
The best-performing model achieved high accuracy score and recall score in detecting fraudulent transactions. The model is also effective in reducing false positive, which are legitimate transactions incorrectly identified as fraudulent.

## Conclusion 💾
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in credit card fraud detection. The developed model can be a valuable tool for financial institutions to enhance transaction security and protect customers from financial losses.

## Suggestions 📎
- Experiment with more complex model architectures, such as deep learning.
- Collect more data to improve model performance.
- Develop a real-time system for immediate fraud detection.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tunnning such as GridSearch, RandomSearch, or BayessianSearch
